# PQ-Aggregate

**Post-quantum threshold signatures via independent ML-DSA key aggregation.**
---

A `no_std`-compatible Rust implementation targeting Solana, Ethereum, and Cosmos via pluggable adapters. Aggregates `t`-of-`n` ML-DSA-65 signatures into compact proofs with Merkle-based public key aggregation.
